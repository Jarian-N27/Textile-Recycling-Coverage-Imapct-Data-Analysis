## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to serve as part of a self-guided learning experience for myself as an aspiring data analyst and learn how data can be used to help businesses identify opportunities as well as showcase the skills and current technologies I learn along the way.

In addition, I wanted to spearhead the creation of a publicly available report in regards to how this initiative has impacted the island since its creation, analyze current operations, and what future opportunities can be identified through the currently available data.

## Steps
1. Gather Data
   - For this project I have utilized the [PR Textile Recycling website](https://prtextilerecycling.com/) to compile information on all of the textile recycling bin locations that are available as of the start of the project in Oct 2025.
     
   - As an initial phase of this project, the following fields have been collected for each bin location:
     - Municipality
     - Zip code
     - Address
     - Name of location
     - Longitude/Latitude
     - Data data entry was created/updated
   
   - All of the information has been added onto an Excel speadsheet that will be made available and free to use.

   2. Tools
      The following tools that are used in this project are:
      - Excel: data collection and preliminary dashboard creation
      - Tableau: data visualization and dashboard publication

    - Outdated custom google map for bin locations on the website that contradict updated google map locations
    - Innacurate bin location pinpoint on custom maps
    - Ambiguous location to attribute the bin placement to
